When the frequency of the gravitational wave becomes equal to the resonant frequency, some phase evolution will occur. After the time at which resonance occurs, the phase can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Phi(t) = \\Phi_{pp}(t+\\Delta t) - \\Delta \\Phi $$\n",

Using this, we can quantify the likelihood of the r-mode hypothesis relative to the no r-mode hypothesis as $ \\log(B^{R}_{\\bar{R}}) $. We can compare the distributions of 'background' and 'foreground'. The 'background' signifies the distribution in the case were no r-modes were injected so the no r-mode hypothesis should be favored and thus the log bayes factor should be less than 0. Similarly, the 'foreground' is the case where r-modes are injected into the data, so the r-mode hypothesis should be favored in recovery and thus the log bayes factor should be greater than 0. Specifically, the fraction of this distribution above 0 is the efficiency. \n",

    "As see in the above plots, the first frequency (blue) is recovered well as the posterior distribution is about 60 Hz, near the injected value. The second value (red) is not constrained at all, and the reason for this is because the algorithm is trying to sample at a frequency after the merger occured, so there r-modes are clearly no longer detectable in the waveform. The last emission before merger occurs at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO),  and the frequency emitted at ISCO can be calculated by this equation:\n",
