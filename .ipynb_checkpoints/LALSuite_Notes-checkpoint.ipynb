    "Rossby modes (r-modes) can be driven by resonances between the orbital and spin frequencies of binary compact objects. This resonance will have some effect on the gravitational wave signal, which we can approximate in the following way. \n",
    "\n",
    "At early times, the phase of waveform will be approximately equal to the phase from orbiting point particles: $ \\Phi(t) = \\Phi_{pp} $. When the frequency of the gravitational wave becomes equal to the resonant frequency, some phase evolution will occur. After the time at which resonance occurs, the phase can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Phi(t) = \\Phi_{pp}(t+\\Delta t) - \\Delta \\Phi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the effect of the resonance will cause an overall phase shift and a time shift in the gravitational wave signal. These can be related by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\Phi = \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t} \\Delta t = \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt}\\Delta t = \\dot{\\Phi}_{pp}(t_{0})\\Delta t $$\n",

    "when $\\Delta t$ is sufficently small so $ \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t} $ can be approximated as a derivative. Plugging this into the above equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "The gravitational wave frequency will be twice the orbital frequency, so $ \\dot{\\Phi}_{pp} = 2\\omega $. Using this relationship we can also say $ \\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta\\Phi}{2\\omega(t_{0})} $. Substituting these in: \n",
